                                FOSS4G is dedicated to providing a
                                harassment-free conference experience for
                                everyone, regardless of gender, sexual
                                orientation, disability, physical appearance,
                                body size, race, or religion. We do not
                                tolerate harassment of conference participants
                                in any form.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                All communication should be appropriate for a
                                professional audience including people of many
                                different backgrounds. Sexual language and
                                imagery is not appropriate for any conference
                                venue, including talks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down
                                other attendees. Behave professionally.
                                Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or
                                exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for
                                FOSS4G.

                                Attendees violating these rules may be asked to
                                leave the conference without a refund at the
                                sole discretion of the conference organizers.

                            <p>
                                Thank you for helping make this a welcoming,
                                friendly event for all.

                            <h2>The Longer Version</h2>

                            <p>
                                Harassment includes offensive communication
                                related to gender, sexual orientation,
                                disability, physical appearance, body size,
                                race, religion, sexual images in public spaces,
                                deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
                                harassing photography or recording, sustained
                                disruption of talks or other events,
                                inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome
                                sexual attention.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                Participants asked to stop any harassing
                                behavior are expected to comply immediately.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Exhibitors at sponsor booths or similar
                                activities are also subject to the
                                anti-harassment policy. In particular,
                                exhibitors should not use sexualized images,
                                activities, or other material. Booth staff
                                (including volunteers) should not use
                                sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or
                                otherwise create a sexualized environment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Be careful in the words that you choose.
                                Remember that sexist, racist, and other
                                exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those
                                around you. Excessive swearing and offensive
                                jokes are not appropriate for FOSS4G.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If a participant engages in behavior that
                                violates this code of conduct, the conference
                                organizers may take any action they deem
                                appropriate, including warning the offender or
                                expulsion from the conference with no refund.
                            </p>

                                Attendees</h2>

                            <p>
                                This procedure has been adopted from the Ada
                                Initiative’s guide titled “Conference
                                anti-harassment/Responding to Reports” and
                                PyCon 2017’s policy.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Contact any staff personnel as listed above.
                                The staff will also be prepared to handle the
                                incident. All of our staff members are informed
                                of the code of conduct policy and guide for
                                handling harassment at the conference. There
                                will be a mandatory staff meeting onsite at the
                                conference when this will be reiterated as
                                well.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Report the harassment incident (preferably in
                                writing) to one of the contact people above -
                                all reports are confidential.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When reporting the event to staff, try to
                                gather as much information as available, but do
                                not interview people about the incident - Staff
                                will assist you in writing the
                                report/collecting information.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The important information consists of:
                                Identifying information (name) of the
                                participant doing the harassing
                                The behavior that was in violation
                                The approximate time of the behavior (if
                                different than the time the report was made)
                                The circumstances surrounding the incident
                                Other people involved in the incident
                                The staff is well informed on how to deal with
                                the incident and how to further proceed with
                                the situation.
                            </p>

                            <p>If everyone is presently physically safe, staff
                                will involve law enforcement or security only
                                at a victim’s request. If you do feel your
                                safety in jeopardy please do not hesitate to
                                contact local law enforcement by dialing 911.
                                If you do not have a cell phone, you can use
                                any hotel phone or simply ask a staff member.
                                All reports should be made directly to one of
                                the staff listed above.</p>
