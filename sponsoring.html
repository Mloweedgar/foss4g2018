                            The FOSS4G Dar es Salaam 2018 Sponsorship Committee has created a variety of sponsorship opportunities for the Dar es Salaam event. Sponsoring FOSS4G, unlike other conferences, is not just about marketing - it is also a meaningful opportunity to give back and a powerful statement about your organization’s role in the open source community. This is specifically relevant to Tanzania and Africa, with many opportunities to geospatially enable the region’s businesses and government.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A healthy global conference is an important part of the geospatial open source ecosystem and strong sponsor support helps ensure users, developers, and contributors can connect and interact on improving the tools we all rely on.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Dar es Salaam Team is offering standard sponsor packages at the Bronze, Silver, and Gold levels. Our higher tiers – Tanzanite, Platinum and Gold – also include a variety of à la carte and customized benefits so that your investment in FOSS4G Dar es Salaam 2018 can best meet your specific objectives for the conference.
